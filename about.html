              I was born in Hong Kong and lived there for 18 years. I
              attended the <a href="http://www.cis.edu.hk/">Chinese
              International School</a>, graduating with a bilingual
              diploma from the International Baccalaureate. I learned to
              love passionate food, healthy habits, and pictures of
              jumping people.
              </p>
              <p>
              I graduated from <a href="http://www.swarthmore.edu/">
              Swarthmore College</a> in June 2015, double majoring in
              Physics and Computer Science. After spending the summer
              backpacking &mdash; one month in Western Europe, one in
              Japan, and a couple of days back home in Hong Kong to
              recuperate &mdash; I moved out to the Bay Area to work at
              <a href="http://nest.com">Nest</a>, where I was offered a
              full-time position on the heels of a fruitful internship.
              </p>
              <p>
              Currently in my fourth month as a full-time adult, I work
              on the Algorithms team for the <a href="https://nest.com/thermostat/meet-nest-thermostat/">Nest Learning Thermostat
              </a>.
              We're responsible for designing, prototyping, and
              iterating on the features that allow our devices to
              provide a delightful and magical user experience. For
              instance, our team is responsible for the machine learning
              algorithms that allow us to learn a user's preferences
              just from how they interact with the device, so that we
              can save them energy and money while keeping them
              comfortable. Working at a Google-backed company with
              startup-esque autonomy and agility is a fantastic blend
              of the two worlds.

              I love learning that many things in nature can be described and explained with mathematics, and I have a passion for developing flexible, extensible, <strong>useful</strong> tools. I hope to explore, understand, and hopefully solve real-world problems using math, code, and a good-natured desire to learn a little more about everything. I'd also like to help make the world run on fusion energy, and to develop an AI that passes the (unrestricted) Turing Test and sasses harder than a J.A.R.V.I.S.-GLaDOS tag team, but I'm trying to take things slowly.

              <p>When I'm not working, I play volleyball, practice
              aikido, and enjoy the sun; I cook less than I eat, I start
              more books than I finish, and I look for
              <a href="http://www.soundcloud.com/adrian-wan">music</a>
              that I can play on repeat. I like breakfasts, memorable
              poems, and brightly-lit tables big enough to spread all
              my thoughts on. </p>
