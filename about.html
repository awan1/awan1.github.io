											<h3>Hi, I'm Adrian.</h3>
										</header>
								  	<p>
								  	I was born in Hong Kong and lived there for 18 years. I
								  	attended the <a href="http://www.cis.edu.hk/">Chinese
								  	International School</a>, graduating with a bilingual
								  	diploma from the International Baccalaureate. I learned to
								  	love passionate food, healthy habits, and pictures of
								  	jumping people.
								  	</p>
								    <p>
								    I graduated from <a href="http://www.swarthmore.edu/">
								    Swarthmore College</a> in June 2015, double majoring in
								    Physics and Computer Science. After spending the summer
								    backpacking &mdash; one month in Western Europe, one in
								    Japan, and a couple of days back home in Hong Kong to
								    recuperate &mdash; I moved out to the Bay Area to work at
								    <a href="http://nest.com">Nest</a>, where I was offered a
								    full-time position on the heels of a fruitful internship.
								    </p>
								    <p>
								    Currently in my fourth month as a full-time adult, I work
								    on the Algorithms team for the <a href="https://nest.com/thermostat/meet-nest-thermostat/">Nest Learning Thermostat
								    </a>.
								    We're responsible for designing, prototyping, and
								    iterating on the features that allow our devices to
								    provide a delightful and magical user experience. For
								    instance, our team is responsible for the machine learning
								    algorithms that allow us to learn a user's preferences
								    just from how they interact with the device, so that we
								    can save them energy and money while keeping them
								    comfortable. Working at a Google-backed company with
								    startup-esque autonomy and agility is a fantastic blend
								    of the two worlds.
								    </p>
								    <p>
								    I love learning that many things in nature can be described and explained with mathematics, and I have a passion for developing flexible, extensible, <strong>useful</strong> tools. I hope to explore, understand, and hopefully solve real-world problems using math, code, and a good-natured desire to learn a little more about everything. I'd also like to help make the world run on fusion energy, and to develop an AI that passes the (unrestricted) Turing Test and sasses harder than a J.A.R.V.I.S.-GLaDOS tag team, but I'm trying to take things slowly.
								    </p>
								    <p>When I'm not working, I play volleyball, practice
								    aikido, and enjoy the sun; I cook less than I eat, I start
								    more books than I finish, and I look for
								    <a href="http://www.soundcloud.com/adrian-wan">music</a>
								    that I can play on repeat. I like breakfasts, memorable
								    poems, and brightly-lit tables big enough to spread all
								    my thoughts on. </p>
